I'm a mathematician interested in topological combinatorics. More specifically, the clique graph operator.

** Research & Teaching

I work at UAEH, where I teach courses on discrete mathematics, linear programming, algorithms, and algebra.

My research focuses on:
- The clique graph operator and iterated clique graphs
- Homotopy types of graphs and their clique graphs
- Graph theory and combinatorics
- Topological combinatorics
