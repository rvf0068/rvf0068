I'm a mathematician interested in topological combinatorics. More specifically, the clique graph operator.

** Research & Teaching

I work at LIMA, UAEH, where I teach courses on discrete mathematics, linear programming, algorithms, and topology.

My research focuses on:
- The clique graph operator and iterated clique graphs
- Homotopy types of graphs and their clique graphs
- Graph theory and combinatorics
- Topological combinatorics applications

** Software Projects

I develop and maintain several open-source projects:

- [[https://github.com/rvf0068/pycliques][pycliques]] :: Python library extending NetworkX to study the clique graph operator
- [[https://github.com/rvf0068/pyreps][pyreps]] :: Python package for representation theory on homologies of simplicial complexes
- [[https://github.com/rvf0068/graphiso.sty][graphiso.sty]] :: LaTeX package for graph isomorphisms in Beamer presentations
- [[https://github.com/rvf0068/gap-cages][gap-cages]] :: GAP package for working with cages (small regular graphs of given girth)
- [[https://github.com/rvf0068/CageConstructor][CageConstructor]] :: Construct cage graphs using SageMath

** Tools & Technologies

- Programming: Python, GAP, Shell scripting
- Documentation: LaTeX, Emacs, org-mode
- Mathematical software: SageMath, NetworkX, SymPy
